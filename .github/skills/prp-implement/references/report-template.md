# Implementation Report

**Plan**: `{plan-path}`
**Source Issue**: #{number} (if applicable)
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status**: {COMPLETE | PARTIAL}

## Summary

{Brief description of what was implemented}

---

## Assessment vs Reality

Compare the original plan's assessment with what actually happened:

| Metric     | Predicted   | Actual   | Reasoning                                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Complexity | {from plan} | {actual} | {Why it matched or differed - e.g., "discovered additional integration point"} |
| Confidence | {from plan} | {actual} | {e.g., "root cause was correct" or "had to pivot because X"}                   |

**If implementation deviated from the plan, explain why:**

- {What changed and why - based on what you discovered during implementation}
