# Initialize AGENTS.md

Generate an evidence-based AGENTS.md file hierarchy for this project. Instead of one bloated file, create minimal per-scope files that load on-demand.

## Why This Approach

Research shows that auto-generated comprehensive AGENTS.md files **reduce** agent task success by ~3% while **increasing cost by 20%+** (Evaluating AGENTS.md, ETH Zurich, 2026). Developer-written **minimal** files improve success by ~4%. This skill generates files that mimic what an experienced developer would write: only non-obvious tooling and conventions.

## Hard Rules

<RULES>
- **NEVER** generate a single file with everything — use hierarchical progressive disclosure
- **NEVER** include directory/file structure listings (research proves these don't help agents navigate)
- **NEVER** include obvious language conventions the model already knows
- **NEVER** exceed 200 lines per file (Anthropic recommendation)
- **EVERY** instruction must pass: "Would removing this cause the agent to make mistakes?" If no, cut it.
- Root file target: **15-40 lines**
- Scope files target: **10-30 lines**
- Domain files: only when non-standard patterns are detected
</RULES>

## Process

### Preflight Check

Check if `AGENTS.md` exists in the current working directory.

**If it already exists:**

1. Inform the user: "AGENTS.md already exists in this project. Switching to the improve workflow to optimize your existing configuration."
2. Invoke the `improve-agents` skill and follow its complete process.
3. **STOP** — do not proceed to Phase 1 or any subsequent phase of this init skill.

**If it does not exist:**
Proceed to Phase 1 below.

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

Read `references/codebase-analyzer.md` and follow its codebase analysis instructions to analyze the project at the current working directory.

Focus: Return ONLY non-standard, non-obvious information that would cause an agent to make mistakes if it didn't know them. Be ruthlessly minimal.

### Phase 2: Scope Detection

Read `references/scope-detector.md` and follow its scope detection instructions for the project at the current working directory.

Focus: Only flag scopes with genuinely different tooling or conventions. A simple single-package project should have ZERO additional scopes. Check shared/library packages for unique constraints even if they are not user-facing, and treat repo-internal tooling directories as root/domain-doc candidates unless they truly need their own config file.

### Phase 3: Generate Files

Before generating, read these reference documents:

- `references/progressive-disclosure-guide.md` — file hierarchy decisions
- `references/what-not-to-include.md` — content exclusion criteria
- `references/context-optimization.md` — token budget guidelines

Using ONLY the information from Phase 1 and Phase 2, generate the file hierarchy:

#### Root AGENTS.md

Read `assets/templates/root-agents-md.md`. Fill its placeholders using ONLY the analysis output from Phase 1 and Phase 2. Follow the HTML comment instructions in the template to determine which sections to include or remove. Remove any section that would be empty. Target: 15-40 lines.

#### Scope AGENTS.md (per detected scope)

If scopes were detected, read `assets/templates/scoped-agents-md.md` for each scope. Only include scope-specific content that differs from root.

#### Domain Files (only if non-standard patterns detected)

If the codebase-analyzer identified non-standard domain patterns, read `assets/templates/domain-doc.md` and generate a file per domain.

### Phase 4: Self-Validation

Read `references/validation-criteria.md` and execute its **Validation Loop Instructions** against every generated file.

The loop evaluates all hard limits and quality checks, fixes any failures, and re-evaluates — maximum 3 iterations. Do not proceed to Phase 5 until ALL criteria pass for ALL files.
For init flows, treat output-size targets as required validation gates: the root file MUST finish within 15-40 lines and each scoped file MUST finish within 10-30 lines. If a monorepo root exceeds target, move scope-specific detail down or trim non-essential context and rerun the validation loop.

### Phase 5: Present and Write

1. Show the user ALL generated files with their content before writing
2. Explain briefly why each file exists and what evidence supports its content
3. Include a concise validation summary: iteration count, final root line count, scoped file count, and any fixes made during self-validation
4. Ask for confirmation before writing files
5. Write all files to the project
