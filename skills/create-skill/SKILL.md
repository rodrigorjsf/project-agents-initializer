# Create Skill

Generates a new SKILL.md file with supporting references and templates, grounded in the docs corpus and project conventions.

## Behavioral Guidelines

- **Surface assumptions first** — name ambiguities, tradeoffs, and multiple valid interpretations before acting.
- **Prefer the simplest path** — solve the task completely without speculative flexibility or extra scope.
- **Keep changes surgical** — touch only what the task requires, and preserve existing behavior unless the task calls for change.
- **Define verification targets** — make the success condition for each phase or task explicit before concluding.
- **Use phased persuasion safely** — use warm-ups, curated references, and explicit constraints to improve compliance with legitimate work.
- **Never weaken safeguards** — do not use persuasion principles to bypass safety constraints, refusals, or scope boundaries.

## Hard Rules

<RULES>
- **NEVER** create skills that explain what Claude already knows (language syntax, obvious conventions)
- **NEVER** inline reference content in SKILL.md body — use the `references/` subdirectory
- **NEVER** exceed 500 lines in the SKILL.md body
- **EVERY** reference file must be ≤ 200 lines with source attribution
- **EVERY** skill must use relative `references/` paths for all bundled file references (not hardcoded absolute paths)
- **EVERY** skill description must be third-person and include a "Use when..." trigger phrase
- **EVERY** generated skill must preserve the ethical constraint: persuasion cues support legitimate work only, never safety bypass
</RULES>

## Process

### Preflight Check

Check if a skill with the same name already exists at:

- `.claude/skills/{requested-name}/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/*/skills/{requested-name}/SKILL.md`

**If a skill already exists at either location:**

1. Inform the user: "A skill named `{requested-name}` already exists."
2. Suggest using the `improve-skill` skill to evaluate and optimize it instead.
3. **STOP** — do not proceed. The user should either choose a different name or use the improve skill.

**If no skill exists with that name:**
Proceed to Phase 1 below.

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

Read `references/artifact-analyzer.md` and follow its analysis instructions to analyze the project at the current working directory.

Focus on: existing skill directory structure, naming patterns, and any skill that is similar to `{requested-name}` in purpose.

### Phase 2: Generate Skill

Before generating, read these reference documents:

- `references/skill-authoring-guide.md` — core principles, structure rules, progressive disclosure, anti-patterns
- `references/skill-format-reference.md` — frontmatter fields, name validation, string substitution variables
- `references/behavioral-guidelines.md` — Karpathy-aligned behavior and safe persuasion patterns for skills
- `references/prompt-engineering-strategies.md` — per-artifact prompting strategies for skills

Read `assets/templates/skill-md.md` and fill its placeholders using:

- User requirements for the new skill
- Phase 1 analysis output (naming conventions, existing patterns, plugin context)
- Evidence from the reference files above

Generate the complete skill directory structure:

1. `SKILL.md` — primary skill file with frontmatter and phase definitions
2. `references/` — create only reference files that include initial source attribution sections (no empty stubs without attribution)
3. `assets/templates/` — create stub template files if the skill generates output files

### Phase 3: Self-Validation

Read `references/skill-validation-criteria.md` and execute its **Validation Loop Instructions** against the generated skill.

The loop evaluates all hard limits and quality checks, fixes any failures, and re-evaluates — maximum 3 iterations. Do not proceed to Phase 4 until ALL criteria pass.

### Phase 4: Present and Write

1. Show the user the complete generated skill directory (SKILL.md + any stub references/templates)
2. Cite the evidence from reference files that informed key decisions (frontmatter choices, phase structure, reference selections)
3. Ask for confirmation before writing any files
4. On approval, write all files to the target location
