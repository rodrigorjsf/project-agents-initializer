# Skill Validation Criteria

Quality checklist for generated and improved SKILL.md files.

## Hard Limits (Auto-fail if violated)

Any skill violating these criteria must be fixed before proceeding:

| Criterion | Threshold | Source |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| SKILL.md body length | ≤ 500 lines | Anthropic: "Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines" |
| Reference files | ≤ 200 lines each | `.claude/rules/reference-files.md` — hard limit |
| Reference files >100 lines | Must include a `## Contents` TOC | skill-authoring-best-practices.md line 403 |
| `description` field | Present; non-empty; ≤ 1024 chars; no XML tags | Agent Skills specification |
| `name` field format | Present; non-empty; lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only; max 64 chars | Agent Skills specification |
| Contradictions between phases | 0 | Claude picks arbitrarily when contradictions exist |

## Quality Checks (All must pass)

- [ ] Bundled file references use relative paths within the skill directory (e.g., `references/...` and `assets/templates/...`), not absolute or cross-directory paths
- [ ] `description` written in third person ("Processes..." not "I process..." or "You can use...")
- [ ] `description` includes what the skill does AND when to use it
- [ ] Progressive disclosure applied: references loaded per phase, not all upfront
- [ ] No reference content inlined in SKILL.md body (should be in `references/` subdirectory)
- [ ] Each phase instruction is concise (≤10 lines); depth lives in reference files
- [ ] Reference files cited explicitly so Claude knows what to load and when
- [ ] `disable-model-invocation: true` set for side-effect workflows (commit, deploy, send)
- [ ] Prompt engineering strategy applied: skill follows relevant strategy from prompt-engineering-strategies.md (role prompting for skills, progressive disclosure for phases)
- [ ] Phase instructions are specific and actionable — no vague directives like "ensure quality" or "review for completeness"
- [ ] Plugin skill body contains no inline bash analysis commands — analysis must be delegated to registered agents (applies to skills in `plugins/*/skills/`)
- [ ] Standalone skill body includes explicit bash commands for each analysis step (applies to skills in `skills/`)
- [ ] Evidence citations present: key decisions reference source docs (e.g., "per skill-authoring-best-practices.md")

## If This Is an IMPROVE Operation — Also Check

**Information Preservation:**

- [ ] Evidence-grounded references not removed (citations preserved)
- [ ] Existing phase structure not flattened
- [ ] Progressive disclosure references not collapsed into inline content

**Structural:**

- [ ] Reference file ≤200 line limit not violated by merging content; >100-line files have a `## Contents` TOC
- [ ] Relative `references/` paths not broken by renaming or moving files

## Validation Loop Instructions

Execute this loop for each generated or improved skill:

1. Evaluate the skill against ALL criteria above
2. If ANY criterion fails: identify the specific failure, fix the skill, restart evaluation
3. Maximum 3 iterations — if still failing after 3 attempts, surface the remaining issues to the user
4. Only proceed to writing skills when ALL criteria pass

**Do not skip criteria for "minor" violations.** Hard limits are hard limits.
