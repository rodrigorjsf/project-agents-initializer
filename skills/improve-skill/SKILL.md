# Improve Skill

Evaluate an existing SKILL.md file against evidence-based quality criteria and apply improvements to optimize token usage, reduce bloat, and align with proven patterns.

## Hard Rules

<RULES>
- **ALWAYS** evaluate before modifying — never change files without analysis
- **ALWAYS** present changes to the user before applying them
- **NEVER** remove evidence-grounded references or citations
- **NEVER** flatten progressive disclosure into inline content
- **NEVER** exceed 500 lines in SKILL.md or 200 lines in reference files after improvements
- **PRESERVE** all genuinely useful skill phases and instructions — only remove waste
</RULES>

## Process

### Preflight Check

Check if a skill exists at:

- The user-provided path
- `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/*/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`

**If no skill found:**

1. Inform the user: "No skill found at the specified path."
2. Suggest using the `create-skill` skill to create a new one instead.
3. **STOP**

**If skill found:**
Proceed to Phase 1 below.

### Phase 1: Evaluate

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/skill-evaluator.md` and follow its evaluation instructions to evaluate the skill at `{target-path}`. Check hard limits (body ≤500 lines, references ≤200 lines, frontmatter valid), structural quality (progressive disclosure, phase structure, reference loading), and token efficiency. Return structured evaluation results with severity classifications (AUTO-FAIL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).

### Phase 2: Codebase Context

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/artifact-analyzer.md` and follow its analysis instructions.

Focus on: which agents the skill delegates to and whether those agents still exist, naming conventions for similar skills, any other skills that overlap in purpose, and the plugin structure.

### Phase 3: Generate Improvement Plan

Read these reference documents:

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/skill-authoring-guide.md` — core principles, structure, progressive disclosure, anti-patterns
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/skill-evaluation-criteria.md` — bloat/staleness indicators, quality rubric
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/prompt-engineering-strategies.md` — skill-specific prompting strategies

Based on both evaluation and analysis results, create improvement plan with categories:

1. **Removals** — bloat (inlined content, over-specified instructions), stale (broken agent refs, removed tools), duplicates
2. **Refactoring** — progressive disclosure optimization, phase consolidation, reference path corrections
3. **Additions** — missing sections (Hard Rules, preflight check, self-validation, output format)

**Standalone constraint**: This is the standalone distribution — suggest only skills and path-scoped rules as improvement targets. Do not suggest creating hooks or subagents (these require Claude Code plugin infrastructure). When evaluation criteria mention hooks or subagents as improvement mechanisms, substitute with the closest available mechanism (a rule for path-scoped enforcement, a skill for workflow guidance).

### Phase 4: Self-Validation

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/skill-validation-criteria.md` and execute its **Validation Loop Instructions** against the improved skill.

For improve operations, also evaluate the **"If This Is an IMPROVE Operation"** section. Maximum 3 iterations. Do not proceed to Phase 5 until ALL criteria pass.

### Phase 5: Present and Apply

1. Show a summary overview of all improvements found, grouped by category:
   - **Removals**: X items (bloat: X, stale: X, duplicates: X)
   - **Refactoring**: X items (progressive disclosure: X, phase structure: X, reference paths: X)
   - **Additions**: X items

2. For each suggestion, present a structured card in priority order (Removals → Refactoring → Additions):

   **WHAT**: The specific content and its current location (file:lines)
   **WHY**: Evidence-based justification with source reference
   **TOKEN IMPACT**: Estimated tokens saved from always-loaded context
   **OPTIONS**:
   - **Option A** (recommended): Primary action
   - **Option B**: Alternative action
   - **Option C**: Keep as-is — "Preserve in current location. Trade-off: continues consuming ~X tokens per session"

   Wait for the user to select an option for each suggestion before proceeding to the next.
   If the user selects "Keep as-is", preserve the content in its exact current location.

3. After all suggestions are reviewed, show aggregate token impact analysis:
   - **Total lines**: before → after
   - **Removed tokens**: total waste eliminated
   - **Deferred suggestions**: X items kept as-is

4. Apply ONLY the approved changes (options A or B selections).

5. Report final metrics:
   - Lines before → after
   - Files affected
   - Estimated token savings per session
   - Suggestions applied: X of Y (Z deferred)
