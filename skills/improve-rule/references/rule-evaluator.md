Follow these evaluation instructions. Analyze either a specific `.claude/rules/` file or the full `.claude/rules/` directory and evaluate the rules against evidence-based criteria. Identify specific problems with evidence so the improve-rule workflow can act on them.

## Constraints

- Do not modify any files — only analyze and report
- Do not suggest improvements — only identify problems with evidence
- Do not evaluate non-rule artifacts (skills, hooks, subagents)
- Be specific: cite exact line numbers and content for each issue found

## Quality Criteria

### Hard Limits (Auto-fail if violated)

| Criterion | Threshold | Source |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Rule length | ≤ 50 lines | Context budget: loaded when matching files read |
| YAML frontmatter | Valid YAML if present | memory/how-claude-remembers-a-project.md |
| `paths:` field | Required; array format; valid glob patterns | memory/how-claude-remembers-a-project.md lines 147-164 |
| Contradictions with other rules | 0 | Claude picks arbitrarily when contradictions exist |

### Quality Checks

| Criterion | Pass Condition |
|-----------|---------------|
| All instructions actionable | No vague directives like "write clean code" |
| One scope per file | No mixing of unrelated topics in the same rule file |
| Rules have `paths:` | Missing `paths:` causes always-loading |
| Glob patterns specific | Not `**/*` unless truly global scope needed |
| No overlap with other rules | Same instruction not repeated across multiple rule files |
| No obvious conventions | Not documenting what Claude already knows |
| No long explanations | Rules are instructions, not documentation |

## Process

### 1. Read Target Rule Scope

If the request names a specific rule file, evaluate that file and cross-check the rest for conflicts.

If the request points at `.claude/rules/` or says to evaluate all rules, evaluate every `.md` rule file under `.claude/rules/` recursively.

For each evaluated rule, record:

- Line count
- Whether `paths:` frontmatter is present
- Glob patterns in `paths:`
- Every instruction bullet in the body

### 2. Check Against Criteria

Evaluate each rule against every criterion above:

1. Count lines — check hard limits first
2. Validate `paths:` frontmatter format
3. Test glob patterns for specificity
4. Check each instruction for actionability
5. Check for topic mixing within the file

### 3. Cross-File Analysis

Search for potential overlaps:

- Grep for similar instructions in other rule files
- Check if the same glob pattern exists in another rule file
- Identify contradictions between this rule and others

### 4. Compile Findings

Organize all issues by severity:

- AUTO-FAIL: Hard limit violations
- HIGH: Vague instructions, topic mixing, overlaps
- LOW: Minor style or specificity gaps

## Output Format

Return your analysis in exactly this format:

## Rule Evaluation Results

### Files Found
| File | Lines | Has paths frontmatter | Paths scope | Status |
|------|-------|-----------------------|-------------|--------|
| [path] | [count] | [yes/no] | [glob patterns or "missing"] | [PASS/FAIL] |

### Hard Limit Check
| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Line count within limit | ✅/❌ | [file] [count] / [limit] |
| Valid YAML frontmatter | ✅/❌ | [file] [result] |
| Valid glob patterns | ✅/❌ | [file] [patterns or "invalid: X"] |
| No contradictions | ✅/❌ | [list or "none found"] |

### Quality Issues
- [AUTO-FAIL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] [File:Line N]: [Description of issue] — [criterion violated]

### Cross-File Issues
- [AUTO-FAIL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] [File:Line N + File:Line N]: [Description of overlap or conflict]

### Summary
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| AUTO-FAIL | N |
| HIGH | N |
| MEDIUM | N |
| LOW | N |

Overall Status: [PASS | FAIL]
```

## Self-Verification

Before returning results:

1. Every reported issue includes a specific file path plus line number or line range
2. Hard limit violations are correctly classified as AUTO-FAIL
3. No improvement suggestions included — report only identifies problems
4. Cross-file analysis performed — other rule files checked for overlaps
5. All criteria in the Quality Criteria section were evaluated — none skipped
