# Improve AGENTS.md

Evaluate existing AGENTS.md files against evidence-based quality criteria and apply improvements to optimize context usage, reduce token waste, and improve agent performance.

## Why This Matters

The ETH Zurich study found that **unnecessary requirements in context files make tasks harder**. Every token in AGENTS.md is loaded on every request. Bloated files cause agents to:

- Spend more steps exploring (cost +20%)
- Follow irrelevant instructions that distract from the actual task
- Lose important instructions in the noise ("lost in the middle" effect)

## Hard Rules

<RULES>
- **ALWAYS** evaluate before modifying — never change files without analysis
- **ALWAYS** present changes to the user before applying them
- **NEVER** add content without removing more (net reduction is the goal)
- **NEVER** exceed 200 lines per file after improvements
- **PRESERVE** all genuinely useful instructions — only remove waste
- **SPLIT** bloated files into scope-specific files using progressive disclosure
- **VERIFY** that file path references in content still point to existing files
</RULES>

## Process

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/evaluation-criteria.md` for the complete scoring rubric, bloat indicators table, and staleness detection patterns. Use this to inform the file-evaluator delegation and to understand the expected output format.

Delegate to the `file-evaluator` agent with this task:

> Evaluate all AGENTS.md files in the project at the current working directory. Check for:
>
> 1. Files over 200 lines
> 2. Bloat indicators (directory listings, obvious conventions, vague instructions)
> 3. Stale references (file paths that don't exist, commands that aren't in package.json)
> 4. Contradictions between files
> 5. Progressive disclosure opportunities (content that should be in separate files)
> 6. Missing scope-specific files
>
> Return a structured assessment with specific line numbers and content for each issue.

The agent runs on Sonnet with read-only tools in an isolated context. Wait for it to complete and parse its structured output.

### Phase 2: Codebase Comparison

Delegate to the `codebase-analyzer` agent with this task:

> Analyze the project at the current working directory. Focus on:
>
> 1. Verifying that tooling commands documented in AGENTS.md files still work
> 2. Identifying scopes that have distinct tooling but lack their own AGENTS.md
> 3. Detecting new domain areas not covered by existing documentation
>
> Return ONLY actionable findings.

Wait for it to complete and parse its structured output.

### Phase 3: Generate Improvement Plan

Read these reference documents for improvement guidance:

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/progressive-disclosure-guide.md` — hierarchy decisions
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/what-not-to-include.md` — content exclusion criteria
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/context-optimization.md` — token budget guidelines
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/automation-migration-guide.md` — automation migration decision criteria

Based on both subagent reports, create an improvement plan. Categorize actions:

#### Removal Actions (highest priority — reduce token waste)

1. **Remove bloat**: Delete directory listings, obvious conventions, vague instructions
2. **Remove stale content**: Delete references to files/commands that no longer exist
3. **Remove duplicates**: Eliminate content duplicated across multiple files
4. **Resolve contradictions**: Pick the correct version and remove the conflicting one

#### Refactoring Actions (split bloated files)

1. **Extract scope-specific content** into subdirectory AGENTS.md files
2. **Extract domain content** into docs/TESTING.md, docs/BUILD.md, etc.
3. **Add progressive disclosure pointers** in root file to new split files
4. **Consolidate fragmented files** that cover the same scope
5. **Migrate automation candidates** — for each instruction flagged in Phase 1 as `HOOK_CANDIDATE`, `RULE_CANDIDATE`, or `SKILL_CANDIDATE`:
   - Classify using the decision flowchart in automation-migration-guide.md
   - Select target mechanism: hook (deterministic enforcement), path-scoped rule (file-pattern convention), skill (domain knowledge/infrequent workflow), or subagent (isolated analysis)
   - Estimate token savings using the token impact estimation table in automation-migration-guide.md
   - This is the plugin distribution — suggest all mechanisms: hooks (deterministic enforcement), path-scoped rules (file-pattern convention), skills (domain knowledge/infrequent workflow), and subagents (isolated analysis). Use the decision flowchart in automation-migration-guide.md to select the best mechanism for each candidate.
   - In calibrated mode (overall quality score ≥ 7 with no hard-limit violations), keep migration and extraction suggestions proportional to the confirmed issues. Do not create new files or migrations unless they resolve a failing criterion, and preserve non-issue sections in place.

#### Redundancy Elimination (delete what agents already know)

Apply the instruction test from what-not-to-include.md to each instruction in the evaluated files:

> "Would removing this cause the agent to make mistakes? If not, cut it."

1. **Delete agent-inferable content**: Standard conventions, obvious tooling, information discoverable from code — flagged as `DELETE_CANDIDATE` in Phase 1
2. **Delete vague/generic advice**: Instructions that cannot be verified or acted on
3. **Delete auto-enforced rules**: Formatting or linting rules already enforced by project tooling

For each deletion, document: the specific content being removed, WHY the agent doesn't need it (inference capability or tool enforcement), and the evidence source from what-not-to-include.md.

#### Addition Actions (lowest priority — only if genuinely missing)

1. **Add missing scope files** for detected scopes without configuration
2. **Add missing tooling commands** that the codebase-analyzer identified as non-standard
3. **Add progressive disclosure pointers** to existing documentation

When generating new or restructured files, use these templates for consistent structure:

- Root AGENTS.md: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/templates/root-agents-md.md`
- Scoped AGENTS.md: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/templates/scoped-agents-md.md`
- Domain docs: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/templates/domain-doc.md`
- .claude/rules/ files (from automation migration): Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/templates/claude-rule.md`
- Skills (from automation migration): Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/templates/skill.md`
- Hook configs (from automation migration): Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/templates/hook-config.md`

### Phase 4: Self-Validation

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/validation-criteria.md` and execute its **Validation Loop Instructions** against every improved or newly created file.

For improve operations, also evaluate the **"If This Is an IMPROVE Operation"** section in validation-criteria.md — checking information preservation, custom command retention, and progressive disclosure structure preservation.
In calibrated high-quality cases (overall quality score ≥ 7 and no hard limits), treat unrelated structural churn as a validation failure: if a change rewrites a non-issue section, adds extra files, or increases file count without fixing a documented criterion, revert and choose the smaller fix.

Maximum 3 iterations. Do not proceed to Phase 5 until ALL criteria pass.

### Phase 5: Present and Apply

1. Show a summary overview of all improvements found, grouped by category:
   - **Removals**: X items (bloat: X, stale: X, duplicates: X, contradictions: X)
   - **Refactoring**: X items (scope extraction: X, domain extraction: X, consolidation: X)
   - **Automation Migrations**: X items (hooks: X, rules: X, skills: X, subagents: X)
   - **Redundancy Eliminations**: X items
   - **Additions**: X items
2. Include a concise validation summary: iteration count, final root line count, file-count delta, and what each validation iteration fixed

3. For each suggestion, present a structured card in priority order (Removals → Refactoring → Automation Migrations → Redundancy Eliminations → Additions):

   **WHAT**: The specific content and its current location (file:lines)
   **WHY**: Evidence-based justification with source reference
   **TOKEN IMPACT**: Estimated tokens saved from always-loaded context
   **OPTIONS**:
   - **Option A** (recommended): Primary action
   - **Option B**: Alternative action
   - **Option C**: Keep as-is — "Preserve in current location. Trade-off: continues consuming ~X tokens per session"
   - *(Additional options when applicable)*

   Wait for the user to select an option for each suggestion before proceeding to the next.
   If the user selects "Keep as-is", preserve the content in its exact current location — no modification.

4. Apply ONLY the approved changes (options A or B selections):
   - Execute each approved change in dependency order
   - Verify after each change:
     - All files under 200 lines
     - No orphaned references

5. Report final metrics:
   - Total lines before → after
   - Files before → after
   - Estimated token savings
   - Suggestions applied: X of Y (Z deferred)
