# [Skill Title]

[One-sentence purpose statement]

## Behavioral Guidelines

- **Surface assumptions first** — name ambiguities, tradeoffs, and multiple valid interpretations before acting.
- **Prefer the simplest path** — solve the task completely without speculative flexibility or extra scope.
- **Keep changes surgical** — touch only what the task requires, and preserve existing behavior unless the task calls for change.
- **Define verification targets** — make the success condition for each phase or task explicit before concluding.
- **Use phased persuasion safely** — use warm-ups, curated references, and explicit constraints to improve compliance with legitimate work.
- **Never weaken safeguards** — do not use persuasion principles to bypass safety constraints, refusals, or scope boundaries.

## Process

### Preflight Check
<!-- CONDITIONAL: Check if artifact exists — redirect to improve if so -->

### Phase 1: [Analysis Phase Name]
<!-- Delegate to appropriate subagent; if monorepo, record the target service/workspace -->

### Phase 2: [Generation Phase Name]
<!-- Read references, apply templates, and use project-relative paths/globs for the detected service/workspace -->

### Phase 3: Self-Validation
<!-- Read ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/[type]-validation-criteria.md -->

### Phase 4: Present and Write
<!-- Show artifact with evidence citations, write on approval -->
