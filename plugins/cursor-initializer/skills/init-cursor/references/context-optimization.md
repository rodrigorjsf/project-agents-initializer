## Hard Limits

| Limit | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Lines per rule file | ≤ 200 | Industry Research: 200-line target for configuration files in this toolkit |
| Instructions per file | ≤ 150-200 | Industry Research: "Frontier LLMs can follow ~150-200 instructions with reasonable consistency." |
| Contradictions between files | 0 | Industry Research: conflicting instructions make the model choose inconsistently. |

> Industry Research generalizes here: bloated configuration files cause the model to miss important instructions.

> Industry Research generalizes here: if a configuration file keeps growing, the model may ignore an instruction even when it is present.

## The Attention Budget

Context is a **finite resource with diminishing marginal returns**. Do not treat it as unlimited.

> "LLMs have an 'attention budget' that they draw on when parsing large volumes of context. Every new token introduced depletes this budget by some amount."
> — Industry Research, Effective Context Engineering

Architectural reason: Transformers create **n² pairwise relationships** for n tokens — attention gets stretched thin as context grows. Models trained on shorter sequences have fewer parameters for long-range dependencies.

**Key principle**: *"Good context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of some desired outcome."* — Industry Research

> Context rot: "As the number of tokens in the context window increases, the model's ability to accurately recall information from that context decreases." — Industry Research

## Lost in the Middle

Critical instructions must be at the **start or end** of files, not buried in the middle.

> Performance is "highest when relevant information is at the beginning or end of the context... degrades significantly for information in the middle of long contexts."
> — Industry Research, Liu et al., Lost in the Middle (arXiv:2307.03172)

**Apply this when generating files:** Place the most important instructions in the first 20% and last 20% of each rule file.

## Quality Over Quantity Checklist

For each instruction line, ask: **"Would removing this cause the agent to make mistakes? If not, cut it."**
— Industry Research

| ✅ Include | ❌ Exclude |
|-----------|-----------|
| Bash commands the agent cannot guess | Anything the agent can figure out by reading code |
| Code style rules that differ from defaults | Standard language conventions already known |
| Testing instructions (non-standard) | Detailed API documentation (link instead) |
| Non-obvious architectural decisions | Long explanations or tutorials |
| Developer environment quirks | File-by-file descriptions of the codebase |
| Non-standard tooling | Self-evident practices ("write clean code") |

**Instruction specificity goldilocks:**

- ✅ "Use 2-space indentation" vs. ❌ "Format code properly"
- ✅ "Run `npm test` before committing" vs. ❌ "Test your changes"
- ✅ "API handlers live in `src/api/handlers/`" vs. ❌ "Keep files organized"

## Context Poisoning Vectors

Detect and remove these before generating or improving rule files:

| Poison vector | Detection | Fix |
|---------------|-----------|-----|
| Stale file paths | Check if referenced paths actually exist | Remove or update |
| Contradictions | Compare instructions across all rules | Remove the weaker/older rule |
| Over-specification | Count lines; check if agent already follows the rule | Delete or convert to hook |
| Failed approach accumulation | Look for rules added defensively after incidents | Remove rules that shouldn't be needed |
| High-churn information | Look for version numbers, file counts, team names | Remove or reference indirectly |

> Treat configuration files like code: review them when things go wrong, prune them regularly. — Industry Research

## JIT Documentation Patterns

Use these patterns to move content from always-consumed to on-demand locations:

| Pattern | How it works | Token impact |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Skills | Description loaded at start; full body loaded on invocation | On-demand |
| `globs:`-mode rules | Trigger only when matching files are read | On-demand |
| `description:`-mode rules | Triggered when the agent decides the topic is relevant | On-demand |
| Domain reference content cited from a rule | Rule references; agent navigates when relevant | On-demand |

> "Rather than pre-processing all relevant data up front, agents maintain lightweight identifiers and use these references to dynamically load data into context at runtime."
