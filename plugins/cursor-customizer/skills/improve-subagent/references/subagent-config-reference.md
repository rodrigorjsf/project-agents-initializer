## Allowed Frontmatter Fields

The Cursor-native subagent frontmatter for this distribution uses **exactly four keys**. No other key may appear.

| Field | Required | Allowed Value | Description |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase letters and hyphens; ≤64 chars | Display name and identifier; must be unique across the project's subagent set. |
| `description` | Yes | Non-empty string, ≤1024 chars | Action-oriented summary that includes a "Use when..." trigger. The agent reads this to decide delegation. |
| `model` | Yes | `inherit` | Cursor-native: the subagent runs on the same model as the parent agent. The product-strict contract requires this value. |
| `readonly` | Yes | `true` | Cursor-native: the subagent runs with restricted write permissions (no file edits, no state-changing shell commands). The product-strict contract requires this value for analysis and evaluator subagents. |

## Model Field

The Cursor `model` field accepts three documented values: `inherit`, `fast`, and a specific model ID.

For this distribution, **the value MUST be `inherit`**. The `fast` value and any specific model ID are not used by generated artifacts. Two reasons:

1. **Product-strict contract (ADR-0002).** Generated subagent definitions cannot embed product-branded model identifiers. `inherit` is the only Cursor-native value that satisfies this constraint.
2. **Operational consistency.** Customizer-generated subagents should run on the same model as the parent agent so behavior is predictable across user environments and plan tiers.

If a Cursor user explicitly opts into `fast` or a specific model ID for their own hand-edited subagent, the customizer does not block that — but the customizer never generates such a value.

## Readonly Field

The `readonly` field is a boolean. When `true`, the subagent runs with restricted write permissions: no file edits, no state-changing shell commands.

For this distribution, **the value MUST be `true`** for every generated subagent. Customizer-generated subagents are analysis and evaluation roles by design; they report findings to the parent agent and do not modify project state directly.

If a future workflow requires a subagent that writes files, the customizer prompts the user to confirm and document the rationale before generating such a subagent — but the default and recommended posture is `readonly: true`.

## File Locations and Naming

Cursor honors several subagent locations. This customizer generates into the Cursor-native paths only.

| Type | Generated Location | Scope |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| Project subagent | `.cursor/agents/{name}.md` | Current project |
| Plugin-scoped subagent | `plugins/{plugin}/agents/{name}.md` | Plugin context |

File naming: kebab-case `.md` filenames matching the subagent's `name` field (e.g., `security-reviewer.md` for `name: security-reviewer`).

## Orchestration Patterns

**Hub-and-spoke** — The parent agent delegates tasks to specialized subagents; subagents report results back. No inter-subagent communication is planned.

**Sequential pipeline** — The parent invokes subagent A, takes its output, and uses it to brief subagent B. Sub-flow within the parent.

**Parallel decomposition** — The parent launches multiple independent subagents simultaneously and aggregates their results.

| Pattern | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| Hub-and-spoke | Independent delegation; one parent, many specialists |
| Sequential pipeline | Task B depends on Task A's structured output |
| Parallel decomposition | Independent reads or evaluations that can run concurrently |

## Constraints

These constraints govern subagents authored by this customizer:

- **Project subagents must not spawn other subagents.** Although Cursor's runtime supports nested launches, this project's convention restricts subagent invocation to the parent agent only. The generated system prompt must not instruct the subagent to delegate further.
- **Subagents do not inherit the parent's conversation history.** Pass relevant context inside the delegation prompt.
- **Subagents do not inherit parent skills.** If a subagent needs domain knowledge, encode it in the system prompt.
- **The frontmatter key set is closed.** Only `name`, `description`, `model`, `readonly` are permitted. Any other key is rejected by validation.

## Foreign-Platform Fields (Forbidden)

The following frontmatter fields belong to other agent platforms and MUST NOT appear in Cursor subagent definitions generated by this customizer:

- A tool-allowlist key (the foreign-platform key spelled t-o-o-l-s) — Cursor uses `readonly` for write restriction.
- A turn-cap key (the foreign-platform key combining "max" and "Turns") — Cursor does not honor a turn-cap in subagent frontmatter.
- A path-scope key (the foreign-platform key, plural of "path") — that key is for path-scoped rule files, not subagents.
- Any literal model alias (such as the small-fast, balanced, or large-reasoning aliases) or any specific model ID prefix — `model` MUST be `inherit`.

These rejections are enforced by `subagent-validation-criteria.md` with explicit examples.
