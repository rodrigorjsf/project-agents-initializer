## Hard Limits (Auto-fail if violated)

Any skill violating these criteria must be fixed before proceeding:

| Criterion | Threshold | Source |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| SKILL.md body length | ≤ 500 lines | Agent Skills best practice: keep SKILL.md focused |
| Reference files | ≤ 200 lines each | reference-files convention |
| Reference files >100 lines | Must include a `## Contents` table of contents | reference-files convention |
| `description` field | Present, non-empty, ≤ 1024 chars, no XML tags | Agent Skills specification |
| `name` field | Present, non-empty, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, max 64 chars, matches parent folder | Agent Skills specification |
| Frontmatter fields | Restricted to `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `disable-model-invocation` | Agent Skills specification |
| Contradictions between phases | 0 | Agents pick arbitrarily when contradictions exist |

## Foreign-Platform Dialect Ban (Auto-fail if any present)

The Cursor distribution is product-strict. The skill tree (SKILL.md, references, assets, scripts) must conform to the following allowlists. Anything outside an allowlist is foreign-platform dialect and is forbidden.

| Check | Allowlist (anything else fails) |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| Frontmatter fields | Only the six recognised by the Agent Skills standard: `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `disable-model-invocation` |
| Bundled-path references | Relative paths from the skill root only (e.g., `references/foo.md`, `scripts/deploy.sh`, `assets/templates/foo.yaml`); no string-substitution variables of any form (no `${...}` or `$NAME` forms inside bundled paths) |
| Discovery-path references | Only `.cursor/`, `.agents/`, and `~/.cursor/` are recognised; no references to discovery directories or memory files belonging to other agent platforms |
| Documentation citations | Local Cursor docs and vendor-neutral research only; no citations to product documentation for other agent platforms |

## Quality Checks (All must pass)

- [ ] Has a self-validation phase that reads the skill's `references/skill-validation-criteria.md`
- [ ] All bundled-path references in SKILL.md use relative paths from the skill root
- [ ] `description` written in third person ("Deploys..." not "I deploy..." or "You can use...")
- [ ] `description` includes what the skill does AND when to use it (trigger terms)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure applied: references loaded per phase, not all upfront
- [ ] No reference content inlined in SKILL.md body (should be in `references/` subdirectory)
- [ ] Each phase instruction is concise (≤10 lines); depth lives in reference files
- [ ] Reference files cited explicitly so the agent knows what to load and when
- [ ] `disable-model-invocation: true` set for side-effect workflows (commit, deploy, send)
- [ ] Prompt engineering strategy applied: skill follows relevant strategy from `references/prompt-engineering-strategies.md`
- [ ] Behavioral guidelines applied: the skill surfaces assumptions before acting, prefers the simplest adequate path, keeps changes surgical, and defines explicit validation targets
- [ ] Persuasion cues, if present, stay inside the ethical constraint: they improve compliance with legitimate work only and never weaken safeguards, refusals, or scope boundaries
- [ ] Phase instructions are specific and actionable — no vague directives like "ensure quality" or "review for completeness"
- [ ] Plugin skill bodies delegate analysis to registered subagents; no inline bash analysis commands
- [ ] Evidence citations present: key decisions reference source docs (e.g., "per skill-authoring-guide.md")

## If This Is an IMPROVE Operation — Also Check

**Information Preservation:**

- [ ] Evidence-grounded references not removed (citations preserved)
- [ ] Existing phase structure not flattened
- [ ] Progressive disclosure references not collapsed into inline content

**Structural:**

- [ ] Reference file ≤200 line limit not violated by merging content; >100-line files have a `## Contents` table of contents
- [ ] Bundled-path references not broken by renaming or moving files

---

## Validation Loop Instructions

Execute this loop for each generated or improved skill:

1. Evaluate the skill against ALL criteria above (hard limits, foreign-dialect ban, quality checks, and IMPROVE-only checks if applicable).
2. **For improve operations:** verify each suggestion in the improvement plan has a WHY field citing a source doc — no suggestion may lack a source reference.
3. If ANY criterion fails: identify the specific failure, fix the skill, restart evaluation.
4. Maximum 3 iterations — if still failing after 3 attempts, surface the remaining issues to the user.
5. Only proceed to writing skills when ALL criteria pass.

**Do not skip criteria for "minor" violations.** Hard limits and the foreign-dialect ban are absolute.
